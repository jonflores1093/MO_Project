Overall Project/Feedback(Unchanged)

With the feedback from my peers about my project, I decided to go
with making a bottle model move back and forth if the user clicked
on it. If the user clicked on it more times then eventually the
bottle would fall and the top would come off. The sand would then
spill out and slowly form into children playing around. Below I 
listed out what was done for the first draft and what I hope to
accomplish during the next iteration.


What was added?

-Added the bottle drop after tapping 3 times on the screen.
-Smoother transition of the bottle dropping and being tapped the first time.
-Added 3D Models of two people
-Scaled Models down
-Added particle effect when bottle falls
-Made it so that the particle effect will go off once the bottle falls
-Added animations of model to get up

What is needed?

-Need to fix the animation of the models
-Need to make sure that the models appear once the bottle drops
-Need to add sand model or puddle model into scene
-Polish off the models, bottle and sand particles

What is difficult?

-Playing around with the animations and seeing if you can attach more than one animation
to a model.
-Finding a good sand model to import.
-Trouble with understanding more of the patch editor.
-Trouble with trying to reset the whole scene and tap counter in an easier way.
